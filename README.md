# MultiClass_Classification_using_NN_From_Scratch
This project demonstrates a multi-class classification pipeline using a neural network with a Softmax output layer. It includes the forward pass logic, Softmax implementation, and probability interpretation for output classes, providing a clear foundation for deep learning tasks.
